Hi, I’m a 2nd year Computer Science & Engineering student.  
This quiz app was built as a personal learning project to practice web development fundamentals.  

I created it using Python, Flask and HTML, and through the process, I learned how to:  
*Write clean and organized backend code  
*Work with CSV files to load questions  
*Build and route simple web pages using Flask  

Future Plans:-  
*Improve the UI with colors, fonts and layout styling  
*Enhance the diversity of questions  
*Allow users to create profiles and track personality changes over time  
*Use collected data (without the name) for research or case studies on personality trends  

This app helped me understand how to structure a small-scale project, and I’m excited to keep improving it!
